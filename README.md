python-jamo
===========

python-jamo is a Python Hangul syllable decomposition and sythesis library
for working with Hangul characters and jamo (U+11xx).

Currently in pre-alpha, only modern Hangul is supported
(no U+317x, ㆀ, ㆄ, or other archaic stuff).
Support for archaic Hangul will probably be added in the future (read: never).

Originally designed to help students identify difficult-to-spell
words containing (ㅔ,ㅐ) or (ㅗ,ㅜ), I found very little in the realm of
open-source Korean language analysis python libraries. Thus, I decided to
make this library fill the niche, in case someone may find this work useful.
