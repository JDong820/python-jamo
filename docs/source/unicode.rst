Introduction to Hangul Representation in Unicode
================================================

Most jamo is represented in Unicode 7.0 in the codeblocks U+11xx and U+31xx.
The extended-A and extended-B blocks are in different codeblocks.
U+11xx represents regular jamo, with inital, vowel, and ending positions.
U+31xx jamo is designated **Hangul Compatibility Jamo**, or *HCJ*. These jamo have
no distiction between initial and final positions, but are much better supported for display.
