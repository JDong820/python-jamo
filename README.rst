Python-jamo is a Python Hangul syllable decomposition and sythesis library
for working with Hangul characters and jamo.

Currently in early beta release, function names are subject to change, but
coverage for all Hangul-related codepoints under Unicode 7.0 is here.

Originally designed to help students identify difficult-to-spell words
containing (ㅔ,ㅐ) or (ㅗ,ㅜ), this project hopes to fill the niche of Korean
phonetic and spelling analysis.


Installation
------------

To install Jamo from `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jamo>`_, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install jamo

Note that jamo is Python 3 only. Viva the bleeding edge! A backport is in
consideration, but is very low priority.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at
`ReadTheDocs <http://python-jamo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
Documentation in Korean is a
`work in progress <http://python-jamo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.


Contributing
------------

Like this project or want to help? Take a look at the issues! I'm active on
github, and will review pulls. I'm open to email as well, so please contact
me if you have any ideas for this project.

Help is needed for the Korean documentation, as Korean is not my native
language.
